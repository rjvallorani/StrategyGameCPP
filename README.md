SPlayerPawn
 
-This is a camera pawn that allows the player to move across the map, using both keys and edge scrolling. The player is also able to rotate the camera by holding down the middle mouse button, zoom in and out by scrolling, or rotate incrementally using keys. Included is a terrain mapping function which will change the yaw of the camera depending on the terrain, preventing the camera from clipping into the map.
